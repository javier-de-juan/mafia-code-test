# Mafia coding test

## Disclaimer

This is the proposal made by [Javier De Juan](https://www.javierdejuan.es). It could be improved or maybe even is not correct.
Debug the code and make a PR if you consider it. Would be appreciated.

Thanks for your time.

## Test

The FBI has captured some Mafia internal records dating from 1985 until the present. They wish to use these records to map the entire mafia organization so they can put their resources towards catching the most important members. We need to track closely who reports to who in the organization because if a boss has more than 50 people under him he should be put under special surveillance.

During these years there have been restructurings, murders and imprisonment. Based on previous investigations, we know how the mafia works when one of these events takes place:

* When an organization member goes to jail, he temporarily disappears from the organization. All his direct subordinates are immediately relocated and now work for the oldest remaining boss at the same level as their previous boss. If there is no such possible alternative boss the oldest direct subordinate of the previous boss is promoted to be the boss of the others.
* When the imprisoned member is released from prison, he immediately recovers his old position in the organization (meaning that he will have the same boss that he had at the moment of being imprisoned). All his former direct subordinates are transferred to work for the recently released member, even if they were previously promoted or have a different boss now.

You are asked to create a computer system for the FBI that allows them to store and manipulate all the records found. Please make sure to write a method to find out whether a boss has more than 50 people under him (or a requested value).

It is mandatory to implements the two interfaces provided in order to start building your solution. Keep in mind that they are minimal interfaces, so you can add all the extra methods you need to your classes.

Some tests are available to the coding test. You can use them and add all the new tests you need.

Keep in mind good design considerations applicable to the problem such as extensibility, maintainability, and modularity, among others. Try to develop the most optimal data structure and algorithms possible to implement the rules described.

Bonus: If you have time, please write a method that given two mafia members identifies which one ranks higher in the organization.

You have 2 hours to complete the test. Language you must use is PHP. Please try to minimize the usage of third party libraries as the goal is to evaluate the code written by yourself. No UI or storage code is needed. A testable code is required as solution.

### What we look at

* This task is designed to give us an idea of how you think when faced with a very limited amount of time to solve a task of significant complexity.
* We are also interested in how you structure your code so that it's easily extendable, complies with best OO practices, and easy to modify /understand by others.
* We are also interested in seeing how efficient the sorting algorithm you implement is.
